==========

-2 add a few more comments especially inside your functions - comment before big blocks of code/ loops/ if/ switch statements - also your comment blocks should also be in your .c file for your functions

-2 when outputting duration into the file - have to insert a 0 if the minutes <10 otherwise in the future the time will be read as 20 minutes instead of 2 minutes
